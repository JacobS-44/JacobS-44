- Hi, my name is Jacob! I've worked in the development realm for over 5 years now, largely on the front-end side of things, but in the past ~1 year I've gotten more into data engineering. I love to learn, and am learning more about data engineering every day. I hope to transition into data engineering full time, and make a career out of it!
